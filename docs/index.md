## Why Forge?

*For Optimization Revolution Greatest Excellence (FORGE)* , is an FIRST Robotics Competition perfomance library made by team FRC 3472, focusing on making the robot program easier, better and ensuring perfomance.

Forge is an **open-source library** consisting in 7 implementations going for **PID constants, or other profile constants** to a **plug-and-play** Swerve pathfinder! But thats not all, Forge also includes easy **simulation implementation** to your robot programm, but the strongest feauture of Forge is `NetworkTablesUtil`, autoPublish values to the NetworkTables, publish any type of data going for simple `double` to `Pose2d`,`SwerveModuleState[]`, `Commands` that you can run with a button; with this feature, if you can image it you can publish it, also comes with other small utils like **flipping poses, math operations**, `Equals`, Forge has it **all** to make your robot's performance rocket up!
